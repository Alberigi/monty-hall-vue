Monty Hall Vue is a Vue.js application built with Vue 2. It simulates the famous Monty Hall problem, providing an interactive game experience.

## The Monty Hall Problem

The Monty Hall problem is a probability puzzle based on a game show scenario. It is named after Monty Hall, the host of the television game show "Let's Make a Deal." The problem can be summarized as follows:

1. There are three doors: one hiding a valuable prize and the other two hiding goats.
2. The player selects one door, hoping to find the prize.
3. After the player makes their selection, the host, who knows what is behind each door, opens one of the other two doors, revealing a goat.
4. The host then gives the player a choice: stick with their original selection or switch to the other unopened door.
5. The player makes their final decision, either sticking with their initial choice or switching to the other door.
6. The door chosen by the player is opened, and the player discovers if they have won the prize or not.

The Monty Hall problem is famous because the optimal strategy to maximize the chances of winning is counterintuitive. Monty Hall Vue allows you to play the game and see the probability in action.
